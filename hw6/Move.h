/* The class Move encodes a move made by one player, including its type
   (PASS, EXCHANGE, PLACE), the tiles used (and use for blanks),
   start square, and direction (if needed).
   It has a number of constructors for different types of moves and
   different ways of constructing them, and also does some basic legality checks
   on the moves. */
