	   The exceptions are exactly the ones thrown by Board::getWords,

	   - "WORD:<word>" signals that the given <word> was not in the dictionary.
	     (E.g., "WORD:brillig" would signal that the move was illegal because
	     "brillig" was not in the dictionary.)
	   When an exception happens, the state of the game is not altered.

	   When a move is executed, the following happens:
	   - PASS: nothing
	   - EXCHANGE: the proposed tiles are returned to the bag, and the player
	               draws new tiles to refill their hand.
	   - PLACE: the word is placed on the board, the score (including possibly
	            the 50 point bonus) is added for the player,
		    the tiles are removed from the player's hand and deleted from the game,
		    and the player's hand is refilled.

	   can show the player their new score, new tiles, etc., which would
	   be harder if the turn is advanced already.
