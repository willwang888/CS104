# CS104
This repository holds all the work I have done for my CS104, Data Structures and Object Oriented Design, class. The repository is still being updated, as I am currently making a Scrabble AI that will find the best moves that can be played with the most number of tiles from your hand, or with the highest score. 

Thanks for visiting!
