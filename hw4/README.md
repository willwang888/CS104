This is a C++ version of the popular word game, Scrabble, that runs
in the terminal. The rules are very slightly modified, but most of the rules are
still the same as the official rules.

To run, clone the repository, and type make into the console. Then, type
./DopeScrabble config.txt, with the appropriate config.txt file.
